# adding a user

Create a user called ejbuser that will be used for securing remote EJB calls:

Adding a user using the add-user.sh command generates an application-users.properties file which
needs be added to the S2I builds configuration directory.
It also also generates the secret that that needs to be placed in the client servers config file:

> To represent the user add the following to the server-identities definition &lt;secret value="dGVzdDEyMzQh" /&gt;

```
h-4.2$ pwd
/opt/eap/standalone/configuration
sh-4.2$ ../../bin/add-user.sh

What type of user do you wish to add?
 a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties)
 b) Application User (application-users.properties)
(a): b

Enter the details of the new user to add.
Using realm 'ApplicationRealm' as discovered from the existing property files.

What groups do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma separated list, or leave blank for none)[  ]:
About to add user 'ejb' for realm 'ApplicationRealm'
Is this correct yes/no? yes
Added user 'ejb' to file '/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/application-users.properties'
Added user 'ejb' with groups  to file '/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties'
Is this new user going to be used for one AS process to connect to another AS process?
e.g. for a slave host controller connecting to the master or for a Remoting connection for server to server EJB calls.
yes/no? yes
```

To represent the user add the following to the server-identities definition `<secret value="dGVzdDEyMzQh" />`
